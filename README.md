## My process

I started out creating the HTML for this project and then adding CSS after. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap


### What I learned

I learned more about grid and flexbox. I learned how to make a horizontal line. I find the creating tiny icons is a bit hard, but I played around with the sizing.

### Continued development

I definitely need to get better at grids and columns and the flex box. I will practice more on that.
